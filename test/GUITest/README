******************************************************************
* Sample Python Script for testing System Architect CoreGenPortal
******************************************************************

* Currently tested in MacOS 10.14 (Mojave) Ubuntu 18.04 (Gnome) and Ubuntu Headless 
  with a CoreGenPortal window size of 1024x768 (MUST be 1024x768)

* Goal: Auto-implementation of steps in CoreGenPortal Tutotial - create new project, 
  add a cache, save project, quit coregenportal. By default all projects are saved 
  to ~/OpenSysArch/<test_name>

Darwin Install / run:
---------------------
Install CoreGen, CoreGenPortal.  Set the environment variable "COREGENPORTAL_BIN" to point 
to the CoreGenPortal binary.
pip3 install pyautogui Xlib pyvirtualdisplay pyscreenshot

To run:

python3 ./test_tutorial.py

Remember to click on CoreGenPortal to bring it to the foreground after it launches.
Also, this is a GUI test... please do not touch the keyboard or mouse or bad things happen


Ubuntu 18.04
------------
sudo apt-get install xvfb scrot
pip3 install pyautogui Xlib pyvirtualdisplay pyscreenshot

Running with GUI on screen - remember to click on CoreGenPortal to bring it to the foreground after it launches.
python3 ./test_tutorial.py

Running on Ubuntu with no X-Display (also works if you have a display attached)
xvfb-run -s "-screen 0 1024x768x16" python3 ./test_tutortial.py

Note that if you choose to run headless on an Ubuntu box where you have a display 
open it will work, you just won't see anything

Command line options
---------------------
** Required args: **
  -r RESOLUTION, --resolution RESOLUTION
                        Resolution of screen in "X x Y" pixels where you are
                        launching CoreGenPortal "Auto" will direct the script
                        to attempt to determine your screen resolution. Multi-
                        monitor environments may have issues
** Optional args: **
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -l, --headless        Run headless using Xvfb, Ubuntu ONLY
  -p PORTAL_PATH, --portal_path PORTAL_PATH
                        Path to CoreGenPortal binary - overrides env var COREGENPORTAL_BIN


TODO:
 - Bring in argparse to manage options for (among other things):
   - Path to screenshots
   - Test names / parameters
   - Path to where you save projects

 - Regular screenshot capture
 - Screenshots from headless gui window manger for verification
